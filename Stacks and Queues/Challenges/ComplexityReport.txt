Complexity analysis
Letâ€™s look at the time and space complexity of this solution:

Time complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1)
 because all operations access array indices directly without resizing.

Space complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(n)
, where n is the fixed size of the array used to implement the two stacks
